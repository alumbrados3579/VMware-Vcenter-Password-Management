### üîß Technical Improvements

#### Progress Bar Compatibility
```powershell
# Before (Unicode issues):
$progressChar = "‚ñà"
$emptyChar = "‚ñë"

# After (Universal compatibility):
$progressChar = "="
$emptyChar = " "
```

#### GUI Layout Improvements
```powershell
# Window now resizable:
$form.FormBorderStyle = "Sizable"
$form.MaximizeBox = $true
$form.MinimumSize = New-Object System.Drawing.Size(900, 700)

# Progress window tripled in size:
$script:OperationStatusTextBox.Size = New-Object System.Drawing.Size(820, 170)  # Was 70px
```

#### Configuration File Formatting
```powershell
# Before (All on one line):
$script:HostsTextBox.Text = "# ESXi Hosts Configuration`r`n# Add your ESXi host IP addresses..."

# After (Proper line breaks):
$defaultHosts = @"
# ESXi Hosts Configuration
# Add your ESXi host IP addresses or FQDNs below
# One host per line, comments start with #

# Examples:
# 192.168.1.100
# 192.168.1.101
"@
```

#### Interactive CLI Features
```powershell
# Command history with arrow keys:
if ($_.KeyCode -eq "Up") {
    # Navigate to previous command
}

# Built-in commands:
if ($command -eq "clear") { /* Clear terminal */ }
if ($command -eq "help") { /* Show help */ }

# Auto-focus after execution:
$script:CLICommandTextBox.Focus()
```
