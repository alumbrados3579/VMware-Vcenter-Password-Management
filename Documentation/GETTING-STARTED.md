# üöÄ Getting Started with VMware vCenter Password Management Tool

## üìã Quick Start Guide

Welcome to the VMware vCenter Password Management Tool - DoD Compliant Edition! This guide will help you get up and running quickly with secure password management for your VMware infrastructure.

## üéØ What You'll Learn

- How to install the tool using the automated startup script
- How to configure vCenter connections
- How to perform password changes safely
- How to use GitHub integration features
- Best practices for secure operations

## üì¶ Installation Options

### Option 1: One-Click Installation (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is with our automated startup script:

```powershell
# Download and run the startup script
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/[USERNAME]/VMware-Vcenter-Password-Management/main/Startup-Script.ps1" -OutFile "Startup-Script.ps1"
.\Startup-Script.ps1
```

**What this does:**
- Downloads all necessary files to your chosen directory
- Creates proper folder structure
- Optionally downloads PowerCLI modules (Modules.zip)
- Creates desktop shortcut for easy access
- Sets up configuration files

### Option 2: Manual Download

If you prefer manual installation:

1. Download the repository as ZIP from GitHub
2. Extract to your desired directory (e.g., `C:\Users\[Username]\VMware-Tools`)
3. Run `VMware-Vcenter-Password-Management.ps1`

### Option 3: Git Clone

For developers or advanced users:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[USERNAME]/VMware-Vcenter-Password-Management.git
cd VMware-Vcenter-Password-Management
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File VMware-Vcenter-Password-Management.ps1
```

## üîß Initial Setup

### Step 1: Choose Installation Type

When you run the startup script, you'll see three options:

#### Full Installation (Recommended for first-time users)
- ‚úÖ All scripts and documentation
- ‚úÖ PowerCLI modules (Modules.zip) for offline use
- ‚úÖ Complete offline capability
- ‚úÖ Desktop shortcut creation

#### Scripts and Documentation Only (For updates)
- ‚úÖ All scripts and documentation
- ‚ùå No Modules.zip (assumes PowerCLI already installed)
- ‚úÖ Faster download
- ‚úÖ Smaller footprint

#### Custom Installation (Advanced users)
- ‚úÖ Choose specific components
- ‚úÖ Selective file inclusion
- ‚úÖ Tailored to specific needs

### Step 2: Choose Installation Directory

**Recommended locations:**
- `C:\Users\[Username]\VMware-Tools` (Default)
- `C:\Tools\VMware-vCenter-Management`
- Any directory where you have write permissions

**Avoid these locations:**
- System directories (C:\Windows, C:\Program Files)
- OneDrive synchronized folders (for security)
- Network drives (for performance)

### Step 3: Complete Installation

The installer will:
1. Create directory structure
2. Download selected components
3. Create configuration files
4. Set up desktop shortcut (if Windows)
5. Display completion summary

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Configure ESXi Hosts

Edit the `hosts.txt` file in your installation directory:

```
# ESXi Hosts Configuration
# Add your ESXi host IP addresses or FQDNs below
# One host per line, comments start with #

# Production ESXi Hosts
192.168.1.100
192.168.1.101
192.168.1.102

# Development ESXi Hosts
esxi-dev-01.domain.local
esxi-dev-02.domain.local

# Lab Environment
10.0.1.50
10.0.1.51
```

### Configure Target Users (Optional)

Edit the `users.txt` file for common target users:

```
# Target Users Configuration
# Add usernames that can be targeted for password changes
# One username per line, comments start with #

# Standard ESXi Users
root
admin
serviceaccount
backup_user

# Custom Users
vmware_admin
monitoring_user
```
