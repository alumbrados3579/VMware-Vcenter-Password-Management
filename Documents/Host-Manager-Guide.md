   - **Host Name**: Descriptive name for the host
   - **Host IP**: IP address or FQDN of the ESXi host
   - **Host User**: ESXi administrator username (typically "root")
   - **Host Pass**: ESXi administrator password
3. **Execute Operation**: Click "Execute Operation" button
4. **Monitor Progress**: Watch progress bar and detailed status
5. **Verify Success**: Confirm host appears in vCenter inventory

**Example Host Creation**:
```
Host Name: ESXi-Lab-01
Host IP: 192.168.1.100
Host User: root
Host Pass: [ESXi root password]
```

**Operation Flow**:
- Validates all required fields
- Locates target datacenter in vCenter
- Adds host to vCenter inventory
- Monitors connection state
- Reports success or failure

#### Listing ESXi Hosts

**Purpose**: Display all ESXi hosts currently managed by vCenter

**Prerequisites**:
- Active vCenter connection

**Process**:
1. **Select Operation**: Choose "List Hosts" from dropdown
2. **Execute Operation**: Click "Execute Operation" button
3. **Review Results**: Host information appears in the host list box
4. **Analyze Data**: Review host names, connection states, and versions

**Information Displayed**:
- **Host Name**: FQDN or IP address of the host
- **Connection State**: Connected, Disconnected, Maintenance, etc.
- **Version**: ESXi version information

**Example Output**:
```
esxi-01.domain.local - Connected - Version: 7.0.3
esxi-02.domain.local - Connected - Version: 7.0.3
esxi-lab-01.local - Maintenance - Version: 6.7.0
```

#### Deleting ESXi Hosts

**Purpose**: Remove ESXi hosts from vCenter management

**Prerequisites**:
- Active vCenter connection
- Host list populated (run List Hosts first)

**Process**:
1. **Select Operation**: Choose "Delete Host" from dropdown
2. **List Hosts**: Execute "List Hosts" to populate the selection list
3. **Select Host**: Choose the host to remove from the list
4. **Execute Operation**: Click "Execute Operation" button
5. **Confirm Deletion**: Acknowledge the confirmation dialog
6. **Monitor Progress**: Watch the deletion process

**Safety Features**:
- **Confirmation Dialog**: Requires explicit user confirmation
- **Maintenance Mode**: Automatically puts host in maintenance mode
- **Graceful Removal**: Follows VMware best practices for host removal
- **Status Updates**: Real-time progress reporting

**Deletion Process**:
1. User selects host from list
