### Key Features

- **DoD Compliance**: Government-standard security warnings and audit logging
- **Safe Operations**: Mandatory dry-run testing before live password changes
- **Bulk Operations**: Change passwords across multiple ESXi hosts simultaneously
- **Role Separation**: Clear distinction between vCenter admin and target ESXi users
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed operation tracking for compliance and troubleshooting
- **Real-time Status**: Live progress monitoring during operations

### Accessing Password Management

#### Via Full GUI Application
```powershell
.\VMware-Password-Manager.ps1
# Navigate to "Password Management" tab
```

#### Via Modular Launcher
```powershell
.\VMware-Password-Manager-Modular.ps1 -Tool Password
# Note: Currently redirects to full GUI for complete functionality
```

### Password Change Process

#### Prerequisites

1. **Configuration Files Ready**
   - hosts.txt populated with ESXi host addresses
   - users.txt populated with target user accounts
   - Files validated using Configuration Manager

2. **Network Connectivity**

   - Network connectivity to all ESXi hosts
   - Proper firewall configurations

3. **Administrative Access**
   - vCenter administrator credentials
   - Sufficient privileges for ESXi user management
   - Target user accounts exist on ESXi hosts

#### Step-by-Step Operation

1. **Establish vCenter Connection**
   - Enter vCenter server address
   - Provide administrator credentials
   - Click "Test Connection" to verify
   - Confirm successful connection status

2. **Configure Password Operation**
   - Select target user from dropdown (populated from users.txt)
   - Enter new password in "New Password" field
   - Re-enter password in "Confirm Password" field
   - Verify password complexity requirements

3. **Execute Dry Run (Mandatory)**
   - Click "Dry Run (Test)" button
   - Monitor progress in detailed progress window
   - Review operation results for any issues
   - Confirm all hosts are accessible and ready

4. **Execute Live Operation**
   - Only proceed if dry run completed successfully
   - Click "LIVE Run" button
   - Confirm operation in security dialog
   - Monitor real-time progress and status

5. **Verify Operation Results**
   - Review final status summary
   - Check detailed progress log for any failures
   - Export logs for compliance documentation
   - Test new passwords on sample hosts

### Security Features

#### DoD Compliance Elements

**Government Warning Banner**:
- Displayed on application startup
- Must be acknowledged before proceeding
- Complies with federal security requirements
- Logged for audit purposes

**Audit Logging**:
- All operations logged with timestamps
- User identification and operation details
- Success and failure tracking
- Exportable logs for compliance reporting

**Secure Credential Handling**:
- Passwords masked in interface
- No credential storage in configuration files
- Session-based credential management
- Automatic cleanup on application exit

#### Safe Operation Procedures

**Mandatory Dry Run**:
- Tests connectivity to all hosts
- Validates user account existence
- Checks permission levels
- Identifies potential issues before live changes

**Operation Confirmation**:
- Security dialog for live operations
- Clear warning about production impact
- User acknowledgment required
- Operation cancellation option

**Error Handling**:
- Graceful failure handling
- Detailed error reporting
- Operation rollback capabilities
- Comprehensive troubleshooting information

### Advanced Features

#### Bulk Operations

**Multi-Host Processing**:
- Simultaneous operations across all configured hosts
- Individual host status tracking
- Failure isolation (one host failure doesn't stop others)
- Comprehensive results summary

**Progress Monitoring**:
- Real-time progress bar updates
- Per-host operation status
- Timestamp tracking for each operation
- Detailed success/failure reporting

#### Role-Based Access

**vCenter Administrator Role**:
- Used for vCenter connection and ESXi host access
- Requires elevated privileges for user management
- Typically domain-based account
- Should have ESXi host administrative access

**Target ESXi Users**:
- Local ESXi user accounts (root, admin accounts)
- Accounts whose passwords will be changed
- Must exist on all target ESXi hosts
- Should be documented in users.txt

#### Operation Types

**Dry Run Operations**:
- Connectivity testing
- Permission validation
- User account verification
- No actual password changes
- Safe for production environments

**Live Operations**:
- Actual password changes
- Irreversible modifications
- Requires dry run success
- Full audit logging

### Best Practices

#### Pre-Operation Planning

**Environment Assessment**:
- Verify all ESXi hosts are accessible
- Confirm target user accounts exist
- Test vCenter connectivity
- Review maintenance windows

**Configuration Validation**:
- Use Configuration Manager to validate hosts.txt
- Verify users.txt contains correct accounts
- Test with small subset of hosts first
- Document planned changes

**Security Coordination**:
- Coordinate with security teams
- Plan password complexity requirements
- Schedule operations during maintenance windows
- Prepare rollback procedures

#### During Operations

**Monitoring Procedures**:
- Watch real-time progress updates
- Monitor for error conditions
- Be prepared to cancel if issues arise
- Document any unexpected behaviors

**Communication**:
- Notify affected teams of operations
- Maintain communication channels during changes
- Report completion status promptly
- Escalate issues immediately

#### Post-Operation Procedures

**Verification Steps**:
- Test new passwords on sample hosts
- Verify service functionality
- Confirm no service disruptions
- Document successful completion

**Documentation**:
- Export operation logs
- Update password management records
- Report to security teams
- Archive compliance documentation

### Troubleshooting

#### Connection Issues
- **Problem**: Cannot connect to vCenter
